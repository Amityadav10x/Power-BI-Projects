        <h1>Churn Analysis of Bank Dataset</h1>

   <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
            The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn patterns in a banking dataset to gain insights into customer behavior, 
            identify key factors contributing to churn, and develop potential strategies for customer retention. 
            By leveraging data visualization techniques in Power BI, this analysis provides a clear understanding of churn distribution 
            across different demographics, credit scores, and account statuses.
