 <h2>3. Infrastructure-Wise Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        The infrastructure-wise analysis looks at the availability and utilization of public charging stations (PCS) across different states. The efficiency of these stations, measured in sales per station, offers insights into how well the infrastructure supports the growing number of EVs.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Maharashtra:</strong> With 3,079 charging stations, Maharashtra is leading in building EV infrastructure, ensuring convenient access for EV owners.</li>
        <li><strong>Karnataka:</strong> Karnataka, with 1,041 charging stations, demonstrates high utilization, with around 1.98K sales per station.</li>
        <li><strong>Gujarat:</strong> Gujarat is also highly efficient, with approximately 4.34K sales per charging station, showing that its infrastructure is effectively supporting EV sales.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This analysis highlights the importance of continued infrastructure development to match the growing demand for EVs.

  <h2>4. State-Wise Comparison</h2>
    <p>
        The state-wise comparison provides a side-by-side view of EV sales and charging infrastructure across major states. It compares the total number of EVs sold, charging station availability, and market penetration rates, offering a holistic understanding of each state's contribution to the EV ecosystem.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Karnataka:</strong> Leading in both sales (313K) and charging stations (1,041), with a market penetration rate of 7.84%.</li>
        <li><strong>Delhi:</strong> Showing strong infrastructure support with 1,886 charging stations and 107K EV sales, Delhi maintains a penetration rate of 6.76%.</li>
        <li><strong>Maharashtra:</strong> With 396K EV sales and 3,079 charging stations, Maharashtra is poised for significant growth, with a penetration rate of 6.49%.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This comparison offers actionable insights into how states are performing relative to one another, helping AtliQ Motors identify potential markets for future expansion.
